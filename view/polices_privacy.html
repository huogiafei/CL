                    <p>Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it.</p>
                    <h5>Usage tracking</h5>
                    <p>We track user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites. However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. We break down overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser).
                        We sometimes track and catalogue the search terms that users enter in our Search function. We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. This helps us continue to build a better service for you.</p>

                    <h5>Cookies</h5>
                   <p>We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. We use cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above). Our advertising system delivers a one-time cookie to better track ad impressions and click rates. You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser however this means you may not be able to access the site.</p>

                    <h5>Use of Information</h5>
                    <p>We use any information voluntarily given by you to enhance your experience in our network of sites, whether to provide interactive or personalised elements on the sites or to better prepare future content based on your interests.
                        We create aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers, sponsors and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their needs.
                        From time to time we may disclose your information to our advertisers, service providers and contractors to help us to provide and market our/their goods and services to you. We may also share your information with third parties who provide prizes for competitions or special offers. If we do this we generally require these parties to protect your information in the same way we do.</p>
